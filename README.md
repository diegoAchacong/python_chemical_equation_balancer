# Python Chemical Equation Code Balancer
This code corresponds to a paper published in the High School Journal of Science in collaboration with Dr. Shireesh Apte.

##
A Python code algorithm for balancing chemical equations as a system of simultaneous linear equations using matrix algebra.

Chemical reactions can be balanced when the coefficients of all the elements constituting that
reaction are treated as variables in a set of simultaneous linear equations. A program was written
in Python to solve the matrix created from these simultaneous equations. The code could balance
any type of reaction and therefore is unique in its universal application.
